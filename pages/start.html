    <p>Congratulations on reaching this point. Your progress indicates a level of curiosity and initiative that may be
      required to continue. To proceed, you must review and accept the following terms:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>All information, materials, and experiences encountered during this process must remain strictly confidential.
        Under no circumstances may they be shared, transmitted, or disclosed to any other individual.</li>
      <li>You may use a large language model or other generative pre-trained transformer as an aid. You acknowledge that
        such tools are not guaranteed to be accurate, complete, or reliable, and their outputs must be evaluated
        critically.</li>
      <li>All tasks must be completed independently. You are expected to observe, research, analyze, and interpret
        information using your own judgment. Challenges may vary in difficulty, with some designed to test persistence
        and problem-solving ability.</li>
      <li>There is no fixed endpoint. The experience concludes only when you disengage or when no further actions
        remain. Recognition of completion will require no explanation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By selecting “Accept”, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to all terms stated above. If you do
      not agree, select “Refuse” to exit immediately.</p><br>
